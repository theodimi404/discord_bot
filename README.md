A Discord bot which has the following functions:

- It can join the voice chat and it can leave it. In the future I want to make it possible to select songs from YouTube
- When a user reacts to a message on the text server, the bot reacts also with a random emoji
- It creates random teams for the currently online users on the server
- It can exclude a certain user, if he doesn't play a certain game
- When a user writes a message which contains a certain word, it sends an emoji as a message. In my example it sends üêé when someone
writes a message that contains the word 'aoe', so it can hype the users to play AGE OF EMPIRES 3.
- Using the keyword map followed by an address, returns the given address in Google Maps
- Using the keyword weather followed by a name of a greek city, returns a 4 day forecast for this given city
- Using the keyword imdb followed by a genre, it returns a random movie in the chat from this genre
